# tth-medialibrary
Files to add to/edit in new projects if they need to integrate our media library

**Note: This repository was not meant to work as a standalone project. It only consists of the files that you'll need to add to your own project for the media library integration. **

**Note 2: Before you begin to integrate all the files, first run `npm install vue-pure-lightbox` to install the dependency. After you've installed it, look for the line `"vue-pure-lightbox" : "^3.1.0"`(version number may vary) in your `package.json` file, and change the version to `"^2.1.6"`**
