# tth-medialibrary
Files to add to/edit in new projects if they need to integrate our media library

**Note: This repository was not meant to work as a standalone project. It only consists of the files that you'll need to add to your own project for the media library integration. **

**Note 2: Before you begin to integrate all the files, first run `npm install vue-pure-lightbox` to install the dependencies. **
